In this sense, Lewis and Henseler are once again among the most valuable hitters, ranking second and fourth in league-wide ISO.

The formula for FIP focuses exclusively on strikeouts, walks, and home runs given up—results that the defense behind the pitcher have no effect on. In that sense, FIP could indicate whether a pitcher is under- or overperforming relative to their true ability, as a FIP lower than ERA could indicate a pitcher has been unlucky due to batted ball luck or their team’s defensive play."
